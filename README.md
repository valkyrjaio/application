# Valkyrja

[Valkyrja][Valkyrja url] is a PHP framework for web and console applications.

About Valkyrja
------------

> This repository contains the skeleton code of an application built with the
> Valkyrja framework.

Valkyrja (pronounced "Valk-ear-ya") is the Old Norse spelling for Valkyrie, a
mythical creature that would guide warriors to Valhalla (the afterlife and a
better place) after death. In a similar sense, the Valkyrja framework guides
your application to be in a better state. Let this fast, light, and robust
framework do the heavy lifting for your app.
